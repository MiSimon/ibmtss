.SH SYNOPSIS
.B eventextend
\fI\,-if <measurement file> \/\fR[\fI\,-v\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Extends a measurement file (binary) into a TPM or simulated PCRs.
.TP
Ignores most EV_NO_ACTION events, but handles StartupLocality.
For \fB\-tpm\fR, StartupLocality power cycles the TPM and sends TPM2_Startup
at the specified locality.
.TP
\fB\-if\fR
file containing the data to be extended
.TP
[\-nospec
file does not contain spec ID header (useful for incremental test)]
.TP
[\-tpm
extend TPM PCRs]
.TP
[\-sim
calculate simulated PCRs and boot aggregate]
.TP
[\-checkhash
verify event log hashes]
.TP
[\-checkpcr
with \fB\-sim\fR verify PCR values]
.TP
[\-pcrmax
with \fB\-sim\fR, sets the highest PCR number to be used to calculate the
boot aggregate (default 7)]
.TP
[\-ns
no space, no text, no newlines]
